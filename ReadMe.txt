Graduation Project: Smart Traffic Light Based on Vehicle Count with Priority for Emergency Vehicles ðŸš¦

I'm excited to share my graduation project: a smart traffic light system designed to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion while giving priority to ambulances and police vehicles. This system uses camera to detect the number of vehicles at each intersection and makes optimal decisions for changing the lights accordingly.

ðŸ”¹ Advantages: Reduce congestion.

Prioritize emergency vehicles. 
Improve efficiency and reduce emissions.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies and Tools:
 
Embedded System 
Computer Vision 
Arduino.
Data analysis software.
